Sync Studios – Terms of Service

Last Updated: Aug 15, 2025

This Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”) governs the use of products and services offered by Sync Studios (“we,” “our,” or “us”). By purchasing, downloading, installing, or using our products and services—including but not limited to FiveM development, Discord bots, web applications, and websites—you agree to be bound by this Agreement.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use our products or services.

1. Business Information

Business Name: Sync Studios

2. Definitions

“Product(s)” means any licensed software, application, script, website, bot, or digital good sold or distributed by Sync Studios.

“User,” “You,” and “Your” means the end-user accessing or using our products or services.

“Use” or “Using” means downloading, installing, activating, hosting, or operating a Product.

“Agreement” means this Terms of Service document.

“Administrator” means an Owner of Sync Studios with the legal authority to grant permissions or exceptions to this Agreement. No other staff, contractors, or affiliates are considered Administrators unless explicitly stated.

3. Use of Services

Products must not be used in any unlawful, abusive, or harmful manner.

You are solely responsible for how you use our products and ensuring compliance with third-party platforms (including FiveM, Discord, and hosting providers).

Misuse—including resale, redistribution, or violation of applicable platform rules—constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

4. Third Parties & Security

Some Products may require third-party hosting (e.g., VPS or dedicated server). You are responsible for the security of your environment.

If a third party acting under your control breaches this Agreement, you will be held responsible.

We provide official support only through Sync Studios channels (website, email, or verified staff). Community advice from Discord or social platforms is not official, and we accept no liability for inaccurate information.

A Product license may only be used by the purchaser. Sharing Products with friends, other businesses, or unauthorized third parties is prohibited unless expressly approved in writing.

5. Product Modifications

You may modify Products for personal use so long as such modifications do not violate this Agreement.

You may not tamper with, bypass, or attempt to reverse-engineer any license or security systems in our Products.

Accessing or modifying encrypted files is strictly prohibited.

6. Distribution Restrictions

Redistribution, resale, or sublicensing of Products is prohibited without written authorization from Sync Studios.

Hosting a Product for your own business or project is permitted. Hosting or providing it for third parties is not permitted without written consent.

7. Credits & Ownership

Removing, altering, or falsifying author credits within Products is prohibited.

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Sync Studios retains full intellectual property rights over all Products.

You may not claim ownership or authorship of any Product.

8. Payments & Refunds

Payments are processed securely through Stripe, PayPal, or other supported gateways. We do not store sensitive payment data.

All sales are final. No refunds are possible once a Product has been purchased and delivered, except where required by law.

If a refund is legally mandated, the associated Product license will be revoked immediately.

9. Warranty & Liability

Products are provided “as is” without any warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.

We make no guarantee that Products will function without error, be continuously available, or remain compatible with future platform updates (e.g., FiveM or Discord).

Sync Studios is not liable for damages, losses, or disruptions caused by the use or misuse of Products. Responsibility rests solely with the User.

10. Violations, Blacklisting & Termination

Breaching this Agreement may result in:

Termination of services and licenses.

Revocation of access to Products.

Account suspension or permanent ban from Sync Studios services.

Permanent blacklisting from Sync Studios, preventing you from purchasing, accessing, or receiving support for future Products.

You may be blacklisted immediately for:

Leaking, redistributing, or cracking Sync Studios Products.

Attempting to bypass licensing or security protections.

Sharing Products with unauthorized third parties.

Exception: The only exception to testing, breaking, or attempting to bypass a Product’s protections is if you have explicit written permission from a Sync Studios Administrator (an Owner of Sync Studios). Any attempts without such authorization will result in blacklisting and termination.

We reserve the right to take legal action for serious violations.

11. Software as a Service (SaaS)

Certain Products are provided on a subscription or rental basis. Once the subscription ends, is cancelled, or revoked, access to the Product and license is terminated.

Some Products may collect non-personal analytics data (e.g., domain, license key, IP address, product version, and usage statistics) strictly for debugging, license validation, and service improvement. Data is never shared in a way that identifies you personally.

12. Amendments

We may update this Agreement at any time. Changes will be effective upon posting to our website. Continued use of our services after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
